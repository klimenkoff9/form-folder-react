# Exercise - Form Edit
Define a Component that displays a user's first and last name in two div tags on the screen along with an 'edit' button
When the user clicks on the 'edit' button, the user's fitst and last name are displayed in two input fields along with a 'save' and 'cancel' button. The 'edit' button and two div tags should not be visible after the user presses 'edit'!
The user is then allowed to make any changes they want and either press 'save' or 'cancel'
If they press 'save' any changes they made are reflected into the two divs
If they press 'cancel' any changes they made are discarded and the divs go back to what they were before pressing 'edit'
